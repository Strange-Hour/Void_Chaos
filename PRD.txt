# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Void Chaos

# Overview  
Void Chaos is a browser-based, sci-fi horror survival roguelite with real-time action and up to 4-player online co-op. Players must survive waves of mutating horrors in abandoned research stations, corrupted alien megastructures, and temporal voids. The game leverages web technologies (TypeScript, React, Next.js) to deliver a seamless multiplayer experience directly in the browser.

# Core Features  

## Player Characters
- **Character Selection**: Implement 5 initial unique survivors with distinct characteristics
- **Abilities**: Each character includes:
  - One signature weapon with basic attack patterns
  - One passive ability affecting gameplay
  - One co-op aura providing buffs to nearby allies
- **Movement System**: Responsive top-down movement with keyboard/mouse and touch support
- **Health and Revival**: HP system with co-op revival mechanics

## Multiplayer Foundation
- **Lobby System**: Create/join functionality for up to 4 players
- **Session Management**: Basic matchmaking with room codes for private games
- **Synchronization**: Real-time state sync of player positions, actions, and enemy behaviors
- **Fallback**: Graceful handling of disconnections with ability to rejoin

## Combat Mechanics
- **Auto-firing Weapons**: Basic implementation of auto-triggered weapons
- **Enemy Waves**: Progressive waves with increasing difficulty
- **Collision System**: Accurate hit detection for projectiles and enemies
- **Scaling**: Enemy health and spawn rates adjusted by player count

## Progression System
- **XP Collection**: Shared XP drops from defeated enemies
- **Weapon Upgrades**: Basic evolution system with 2-3 upgrade paths per weapon
- **Passive Items**: Collectible passive modules enhancing character abilities
- **Session Persistence**: Progress saved within game session

## Stage Design
- **Initial Stage**: One complete stage with appropriate enemy types and obstacles
- **Co-op Elements**: Basic co-op-focused terrain features (choke points, open areas)
- **Time Limit**: Wave-based progression with timer mechanics

# User Experience  

## User Personas
- **Solo Player**: Enjoys challenging roguelite experiences
- **Casual Co-op Group**: Friends looking for quick, accessible multiplayer sessions
- **Competitive Team**: Players focused on achieving high scores and efficient builds

## Key User Flows
- **Game Entry**: Homepage → Character Selection → Game Session
- **Multiplayer Setup**: Create/Join Lobby → Invite Friends → Ready Up → Start Game
- **In-Game Loop**: Combat → Collect XP → Level Up → Select Upgrades → Repeat
- **Revival Flow**: Player Death → Team Revival Mechanic → Rejoin Combat

## UI/UX Considerations
- **HUD Design**: Clean, minimalistic UI showing essential information
- **Multiplayer Indicators**: Clear visual cues for ally positions and status
- **Feedback Systems**: Impactful visual and audio cues for combat events
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Adaptive controls for various device types

# Technical Architecture  

## System Components
- **Rendering Engine**: Canvas-based 2D rendering system
- **Game Logic**: Entity Component System (ECS) for game objects and behaviors
- **Input Handler**: Unified input system supporting multiple device types
- **Network Layer**: WebSocket implementation with state synchronization
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API implementation for sound effects and music

## Data Models
- **Player Entity**: Position, rotation, health, weapons, upgrades
- **Enemy Entity**: Type, health, behavior pattern, targeting logic
- **Weapon System**: Damage, cooldown, projectile properties, evolution paths
- **Game State**: Wave information, timer, active enemies, collectibles

## APIs and Integrations
- **Multiplayer Backend**: Socket.IO or similar for WebSocket communication
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **Data Persistence**: IndexedDB for local save data
- **Authentication**: Simple username/session system for multiplayer identification

## Infrastructure Requirements
- **Frontend Hosting**: Static site deployment (Vercel/Netlify)
- **Backend Server**: Lightweight Node.js server for WebSocket communication
- **Asset Delivery**: CDN optimization for sprites and audio

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges
- **Network Latency**: Implement client-side prediction and server reconciliation
- **Browser Performance**: Optimize rendering and limit particle effects
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Extensive testing across devices and browsers
- **Scalability**: Design backend to handle concurrent game sessions efficiently

## MVP Scoping
- **Feature Creep Risk**: Strict adherence to MVP definition with clear acceptance criteria
- **Complexity Management**: Start with simplified systems that can be expanded
- **Vertical Slice Approach**: Build one complete character/stage first before expanding

## Resource Constraints
- **Asset Creation**: Use procedural generation and asset packs for initial development
- **Testing Limitations**: Implement automated testing for core systems
- **Development Bandwidth**: Focus on core gameplay loop before expanding features
